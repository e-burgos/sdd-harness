# Changelog

All notable changes to `@e-burgos/sdd-harness` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.12.1] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **`harness init` failed at `pnpm install` on 0.12.0.** Both generators install dependencies
  *before* the SDD kit lands, and the new `postinstall` (`node sdd/scripts/setup-rtk.mjs`)
  died with "Cannot find module" because `sdd/` did not exist yet — every fresh `init` was
  broken, and the examples repo could not regenerate. The shipped `postinstall` now checks
  that the script exists before running it (same inline-node style as `setup:agents`); rtk is
  still left operational by `setup-agents` right after the kit is installed. Regression test:
  the template's `postinstall` exits 0 in a directory without `sdd/`.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added — rtk on by default: compressed shell output for the agents

- **rtk ([rtk-ai/rtk](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk)) ships enabled with the kit, zero developer
  action.** rtk compresses the output of shell commands (git, pnpm, vitest, tsc, eslint, ls, grep,
  docker…) before an agent reads it — 60–90 % less text on those outputs, file reads untouched.
  The kit never runs `rtk init` (it would edit the symlinked `CLAUDE.md` and prompt for rtk's
  telemetry); instead it ships its own bridge and installer:
  - `sdd/scripts/rtk-hook.mjs <claude|gemini>` — the hook entry point. Reads `sdd/tools.json`,
    finds the binary (`RTK_BIN` → PATH → per-user install dir) and delegates to `rtk hook`.
    Any other case is a silent passthrough (no stdout, exit 0): it never blocks a command.
  - `sdd/scripts/setup-rtk.mjs` — idempotent: merges the hooks into `.claude/settings.json`
    (`PreToolUse` · `Bash`) and `.gemini/settings.json` (`BeforeTool` · `run_shell_command`)
    without clobbering other hooks (an existing `rtk init` hook is respected), then installs the
    pinned release (`0.48.0`) from GitHub Releases with the SHA-256 verified against the release's
    `checksums.txt`, into `~/.local/bin` (Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\rtk\bin`) — never inside the
    repo. Skipped in `CI`, with `SDD_RTK_SKIP_INSTALL`, or when a same-or-newer `rtk` is on PATH.
    Any failure prints one warning with the manual install command and exits 0. Flags:
    `--status` (JSON), `--enable`, `--disable`, `--no-install`.
  - `sdd/scripts/rtk-common.mjs` — shared lookup/version helpers (also used by the viewer).
  - `setup-agents.sh/.ps1` call `setup-rtk.mjs` at the end, so `init`, `configure sdd`,
    `update sdd` and `pnpm setup:agents` all leave rtk operational. The generated `package.json`
    gets `sdd:rtk` and — only when the project has none — a `postinstall` running the same
    script, so a fresh clone picks the binary up at `pnpm install`.
- **`sdd/tools.json` + `schemas/tools.schema.json`** — the switch, owned by the project
  (`update sdd` seeds it once and never overwrites it): `rtk.enabled`, `rtk.auto_install`
  (blocked networks: install by hand, the bridge finds it on PATH), optional `rtk.version`.
  `pnpm sdd:rtk -- --disable|--enable` flips it; the **sdd-steward** does it on request
  (new Playbook 5) and reports rtk in its status. `sdd:validate` validates the file.
- **Costs page in four tabs with charts** (`#/costs/general|specs|fixes|rtk`), inline SVG (no
  libraries), colour-blind-validated palettes, tooltips on every mark, and every long list as a
  fixed-height scrollable table: **General** (KPIs, traditional vs agentic per spec, cost per
  agent, tokens per provider, telemetry origin), **Specs** (cycles only), **Fixes** (by type,
  severity and status, tokens per fix), **RTK** (status, KPIs — compressed commands, tokens
  generated / read / saved, approx. USD equivalent — last 30 days read vs saved, cumulative
  savings, per month, savings per command family, recent commands). `serve.mjs` gains
  `/sdd/docs/__rtk`: runs `rtk gain --project --all --format json` scoped to the repo and reads
  per-command detail from rtk's local SQLite history with `node:sqlite` (Node ≥ 22.5; omitted
  otherwise). rtk keeps its history per user, so the tab shows the machine running `sdd:docs`.
- Dual-harness (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md`) gets an rtk section for the agents: the
  rewrite is transparent, never prefix `rtk` by hand, `rtk proxy <cmd>` for raw output, never
  disable it on your own.

### Tests

- `rtk.integration.spec.ts`: hooks merge and idempotence, native-hook respect, invalid JSON,
  bridge passthrough/delegation with a fake binary, `--disable/--enable/--status`, skip rules,
  and a full install (download + checksum + extract) against a local HTTP release server,
  including a checksum mismatch. Integration and update suites assert the hooks, `tools.json`
  and the package.json scripts; vitest sets `SDD_RTK_SKIP_INSTALL` so no suite ever downloads.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-09-02

Everything in this release comes from one real end-to-end run of the CLI (v0.10.3) on
2026-09-02: `harness idea` → `init --config` → `add spec` → skill `sdd-hermes` on a new Nx
repo with a NestJS API and a React back-office. The workspace came out, but five
reproducible bugs, a handful of flow frictions and a hole in the cost telemetry surfaced.

### Fixed — five bugs from the real run

- **`init --config` nested the workspace in `<name>/<name>/`** when run inside a directory
  that was already `git init`-ed and held the `harness.*` files. It also re-ran `git init`
  there and left the idea/config files outside. Now `init` generates **in the current
  directory** when the config lives there, when `basename(cwd) == project.name`, or with the
  new `--here` / `--dir .` flags; an existing git repo is never re-initialized (the initial
  commit lands on the current branch); an existing `.gitignore` is merged, an existing
  `README.md` is kept; and `harness.idea.md`, `harness.config.json` and
  `harness.config.schema.json` travel into the workspace when it is generated elsewhere. A
  non-empty destination is only accepted when it holds nothing but a git repo, README/LICENSE
  and the harness files.
- **The NestJS template neither built nor tested.** `@nx/webpack:webpack` ran without a
  `webpackConfig` and died with `Can't resolve './src'`; the `test` target pointed at a
  `jest.config.ts` that did not exist (and would have needed `ts-node`). The template now
  builds by inference — `@nx/webpack/plugin` in `nx.json` (its `serve` renamed so it never
  shadows the app's own) + `apps/<name>/webpack.config.js` with `NxAppWebpackPlugin` — which
  is also the non-deprecated path (Nx removes the executor in v24). Tests run with
  `@nx/jest:jest` over a CommonJS `jest.config.js`, a root `jest.preset.js` and a
  `tsconfig.spec.json` with `jest`/`node` types and decorator metadata; a real
  `app.controller.spec.ts` ships so `nx test` exercises Nest's testing module. `serve` runs
  node over the bundle. `harness add app nestjs` on a workspace without Nest apps adds the
  plugin and the preset itself. Verified with a real generation: `nx run-many -t lint test
  build` green for nestjs + react + two libs.
- **`apps[].port` was ignored.** The port now lands in the code as
  `Number(process.env['<APP>_PORT'] ?? process.env['PORT'] ?? <port>)` (Vite `server.port`
  for react), in `.env.example` (one `<APP>_PORT=` per app — a single `PORT` is ambiguous in
  a monorepo) and in the generated root `README.md`. `.env.example` is now written even
  without docker services.
- **`add spec` never registered the module in `global.json`, and `sdd.modules` did nothing.**
  `harness add spec` now writes the `ModuleEntry` into `pending_modules`
  (`{module, spec, apps, cycles_completed: 0, description}`) besides the specs index, and
  grew `--apps apps/a,libs/b`, `--depends-on <spec-id|slug>` (repeatable, resolved against
  the index) and `--description`. `sdd.modules` in the config now **seeds** the backlog at
  `init`: one `draft` spec `spec-<sdd.author>-NNN-<slug>` + `pending_modules` entry per
  module (strings or `{ name, title?, description?, app?, apps?, depends_on? }`,
  dependencies resolved by slug in order). New `sdd.author` field; without it the git
  user name is used with a warning. One implementation (`spec.generator.ts`) serves both
  paths.
- **Specs were born `in-progress`.** New initial status `draft` in `specs/index.json`
  (`draft | in-progress | completed | cancelled`): `add spec` writes it, the
  sdd-orchestrator promotes it to `in-progress` when it opens `cycle-01`. The viewer shows
  it as *Borrador / Draft*. Existing indexes are **not** rewritten (rule: `update sdd` never
  touches data): the validator suggests the migration with a one-line warning listing
  the `in-progress` specs that have no cycle.

- **`configure sdd` (and `update sdd`, `pnpm setup:agents`) destroyed the repo's own
  harness.** `setup-agents.sh` did `rm -rf` on any real `.claude/agents`, `.claude/skills`,
  `.claude/commands`, `.github/agents` and on any `.github/skills/<name>` or
  `.agents/skills/<name>` that collided with a kit skill, and the PowerShell variant
  overwrote a real root `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md`. The scripts are now
  non-destructive: a real directory is kept and the kit items are linked inside it; a
  collision keeps yours and leaves the kit version next to it as `<name>.new` (a copy for
  files, a pointer note for directories), listed in a summary at the end. A real root
  instruction file is kept with its `.new` as well; `configure sdd` keeps absorbing it into
  `sdd/dual-harness/` first, and a second `configure sdd` (reset) now carries over what an
  earlier install had absorbed instead of dropping it.

### Added — the idea → Hermes flow, from real use

- `harness.idea.md` is now the FASE 1 logbook: `## Evidencia del descubrimiento`
  (table *Fuente | Estado de acceso | Dato medido | Fecha*) and `## Decisiones del dev`
  (dated), filled by the agent and **cited** by the specs (the spec template has an
  *Evidencia y decisiones* section for it) instead of being copied by hand into each one.
- The protocol inside the idea file is **self-contained for FASE 1–3** — need → piece
  matrix, standalone vs nx rule, `init` in the cwd, the gate — because in an empty repo
  the `sdd-hermes` skill does not exist yet.
- `harness idea --author <gh-user>` lands in `sdd.author` of the config stub (the stub now
  also carries `apps[0].port` and `sdd.modules: []`). `harness idea --show` prints the
  registered idea, evidence and decisions.
- **`init` runs the FASE 3 gate instead of trusting it**: `sdd:validate` +
  `nx run-many -t lint test build` (nx) or the `lint`/`test`/`build` scripts (standalone),
  printed as a checklist and executed. Red → `init` exits 1 and skips the initial commit.
  `--skip-verify` opts out. Until now `init` reported success after running only the
  registry validator.
- **`NX_WORKSPACE_ROOT_PATH` guard.** If the variable is set and does not point at the cwd,
  `init`, `add`, `update` and every `sdd:*` script warn on their first line. Real case: in
  Claude Code with another repo as primary directory, `nx run-many -t build` inside the new
  repo built the *other* repo and reported success. Also recorded in the kit's `lessons.md`
  and the dual-harness.
- `npm.scopes[]` in the config (`{ scope, registry }`) → `@scope:registry=` lines in the
  generated `.npmrc`, with the note that credentials live in `~/.npmrc` locally and
  `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` in CI, never in the repo file.
- `hermes-resume` now reads `harness.idea.md` and **declares the FASE (1–5)** from which
  files exist before diagnosing the loop position.
- Root `README.md` for nx workspaces (apps with type, port and serve command, SDD pointers).
- Opt-in real E2E test (`HARNESS_E2E=1 npx vitest run src/__e2e__`): `idea` + `init --config`
  in a git-initialized directory, generation in place, ports honored, gate green.

### Changed — cost telemetry per agent (mandatory)

The ⚙️ rule asked for `metrics.usage` per cycle, `usage.model_tier` per task and `usage`
per fix, and v0.10.3 said "whoever executes records, the reviewer consolidates". In the real
run the total was still estimated at close and the per-agent detail was lost. New rule,
non-negotiable: **every agent that takes part in an SDD flow or a fix and consumes tokens
records, when it closes its unit of work, provider/model, effort, tokens_in, tokens_out,
source and approx.** Without it the unit is not closed and `sdd:validate` says so.

- **Schemas.** `cycle.schema.json` → `metrics.usage.by_agent[]`
  (`{ agent, label?, provider_model, effort, tokens_in, tokens_out, tokens_total?, approx,
  source, recorded_at, duration_minutes?, tool_uses? }`, `agent` ∈ functional | planner |
  architect | implementor-back | implementor-front | reviewer | orchestrator | steward |
  hermes | custom) with `by_tier` **derived** from it. `cycle-tasks.schema.json` and
  `fixes.schema.json` → `usage.provider_model` (`model_tier` stays as the legacy alias),
  `effort`, `agent`, `recorded_at`, `tokens_total`; fixes also take `by_agent[]`. Nothing
  moved to `required` in the schemas — old records keep validating; the protocol and the
  validator enforce the new fields on new units.
- **New `source`: `agent-usage-notification`.** In Claude Code, when a subagent launched
  with the `Agent` tool finishes, the parent receives
  `<usage><subagent_tokens>N</subagent_tokens><tool_uses>…</tool_uses><duration_ms>…</duration_ms></usage>`
  — an exact per-subagent measurement that costs the dev nothing. It goes in as
  `tokens_total: N` (default 85/15 split into in/out when the harness gives a single
  number), `approx: false`. Only the main loop still needs the session report. The
  equivalents are documented for Gemini CLI (`/stats` for the main loop, declared estimate
  for its subagents), Copilot and Antigravity (declared estimate, `approx: true`).
- **Agents, skills and prompts.** Every `sdd/agents/*.agent.md` and every `sdd-*` skill end
  with a *Registro de consumo (obligatorio)* section (what file, which fields, declare
  model/effort before, record tokens at close). The orchestrator creates `metrics` with
  zeroed counters and `usage.by_agent: []` when it opens the cycle, captures each
  usage notification, and does not mark a task `done` without its `usage`; the reviewer
  does not close without a complete `by_agent` whose sums match `by_tier`;
  `start-sdd-cycle`, `review-cycle`, `hotfix-bypass-gate` and `hermes-resume` carry the
  step; the FIX GATE does not close a fix without `usage`.
- **Validator.** Error when a cycle completed on/after 2026-09-02 (or a fix resolved from
  that date) has no `usage` with provider/model + tokens; error on `approx: false` with
  `source: declared-estimate` anywhere; warning when `by_agent` is missing, when
  `sum(by_agent) != by_tier` or the top-level totals differ from the breakdown, and when a
  done task of a gated cycle has no usage. Units closed before the cutoff keep the previous
  behavior (aggregated warnings) — history is not rewritten.
- **Costs view.** New *by agent* and *by provider/model* aggregations, an *Origen* column
  (`exacto` / `estimado` / `mixto`), cost computed with the per-model rates of
  `sdd/pricing.json`, fixes listed in the same table as cycles and included in the
  traditional-vs-agentic comparison, `by_agent` shown in the cycle detail. Source priority:
  `by_agent` → `by_tier` → task usage → top-level totals.
- **Dual-harness.** The canonical ⚙️ table gains the row *registro de consumo por agente:
  obligatorio — fuente y formato*, the telemetry section is rewritten around `by_agent`
  and the per-harness source table, `rules/sdd-model-budget.md` (kit-owned, so it reaches
  every install) carries the condensed version, and `lessons.md` ships seed lessons: without
  a per-unit record the cycle total is rebuilt from memory and the dashboard lies; capture
  `subagent_tokens` when the notification arrives; check `NX_WORKSPACE_ROOT_PATH` before any
  `nx`; never call an `init` green without lint/test/build.

### Notes for existing installs

- `harness update sdd` applies the kit changes without touching specs, cycles, fixes,
  contexts or memory; team-edited kit files and the dual-harness hybrids arrive as `*.new`.
  Verified against a v0.10.3 workspace with a customized reviewer agent and a hand-written
  spec: only `kit.json` changed in git besides the kit files, five `.new` files appeared.
- The validator will print one warning per repo for `in-progress` specs without cycles
  (set them to `draft`) and one for resolved fixes / completed cycles older than the cutoff
  without usage. Nothing that validated before fails now.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-08-20

### Changed — telemetry is consolidated, not reconstructed

The TELEMETRÍA GATE said *what* to record and *where*, but not *when*, so the
reviewer was left rebuilding a whole cycle's consumption from memory at close —
the moment with the least information about what each task actually cost.

Credit where it is due: this model comes from `front-ypf-bo-mfe`, whose team had
written it into their own copy of the reviewer skill before the kit had anything
to say about telemetry. A v0.9.0 update destroyed that customization (the bug
fixed in v0.9.3/v0.9.4); recovering it from git is what surfaced the idea.

- **Whoever executes records; the reviewer consolidates.** `usage` is written
  when each unit of work closes — the implementor on the task, whoever resolves
  a fix on the fix — and the cycle total is **summed** from those, grouped by
  `provider/model` into `by_tier`.
- The reviewer's own estimating is now scoped to what no unit covered: the
  review itself, coordination, the documents.
- A `by_tier` entry summing a measured part with an estimated one comes out
  `approx: true` — a total is only as honest as its weakest part.
- Nothing recorded when the reviewer reaches the close means something failed
  upstream: it goes in `reviewer_report.notes` on top of estimating the total.

Documented across the reviewer agent and skill, both implementors, the FIX GATE
prompt, `sdd-data-schemas`, the dual-harness rule and both languages of the kit
docs. No schema change — the shape was already right, only the protocol moved.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- `update sdd` left a repo without `sdd/memory/journal/`, the directory the
  MEMORIA GATE writes into. A fresh install copies the kit wholesale and gets
  the `.gitkeep` that holds the directory in git; the update walks the manifest
  instead, and `memory/journal/` is classified as **data** — correctly, nobody
  wants an update touching journal entries — so its placeholder was filtered out
  along with the entries. Updated repos ended up structurally different from
  freshly installed ones.

  The update now restores kit-shipped `.gitkeep` placeholders inside data
  directories when the directory is missing, and only then: an existing journal
  is never touched, and no entry is ever overwritten.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed — the SDD Tools pages showed untranslated or empty descriptions

Four separate defects behind the same symptom:

- **Agent and skill descriptions were never translated.** Their cards rendered
  `escapeHtml(description)` with no `t()` around it, so the viewer showed the raw
  frontmatter whatever the selected language was. Prompts already went through
  `t()`; agents and skills now do too.
- **`description: >` rendered as a literal `>`.** The frontmatter parser read
  whatever followed `description:` on the same line, so the two skills using a
  YAML folded block scalar (`sdd-data-schemas`, `sdd-file-structure`) came out
  with `>` as their whole description. Block scalars (`>`, `|`, with or without
  chomping) are folded now, and the skill view — which had its own copy of the
  parser — shares the fixed one.
- **Two prompts had no description at all.** `hermes-resume` and `sdd-steward`
  were missing from the viewer's fallback catalog, so they fell through to
  `description: ''`.
- **The kit's own descriptions mixed languages.** `sdd-reviewer`'s skill
  frontmatter was in English while the other 18 were in Spanish. Normalized to
  Spanish, the kit's source language.

All 27 kit descriptions (8 agents + 19 skills) plus the 6 prompt entries now
have English translations in the viewer dictionary, verified by parsing every
frontmatter and asserting a dictionary hit for each.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added — Memoria view: the project's learnings, finally visible

The MEMORIA GATE has been writing `memory/lessons.md` and `memory/journal/*.md`
since v0.4, and the viewer never showed either. The one artifact that explains
*why* a project does things the way it does was write-only.

- **New `Memoria` view** (SDD section) rendering distilled lessons on top and the
  episodic journal below as a timeline, newest first, each entry collapsible with
  its markdown rendered and a `ciclo`/`fix` badge parsed from the filename.
- **Surfaces the gate's own thresholds**: a notice when the journal reaches the
  distillation threshold (≥5 entries, matching what `sdd:validate` warns about),
  and another when `lessons.md` passes its 120-line cap.
- **`catalog.json` gains a `memory` section** listing `memory/journal/*.md`
  newest first, so the view works on static hosting where directory listing is
  unavailable. The section is optional in the schema, so catalogs generated
  before this release keep validating; `pnpm sdd:rebuild-catalog` adds it and
  `sdd:validate` now checks it for staleness like the others.
- Reactive like every other view: `memory` was already a fingerprint area in
  `serve.mjs`, so closing a cycle refreshes it without a reload.

### Fixed

- `rebuild-catalog.mjs` did nothing, silently, when invoked through a path that
  differs from its realpath — its `isMain` guard compared `import.meta.url`
  (already resolved) against `process.argv[1]` (not resolved). On macOS any run
  under a temp dir (`/var` → `/private/var`) fell through as if imported, wrote
  no catalog and exited 0. Both sides are realpath'd now.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **v0.9.3 stopped new manifests from being poisoned; it did not heal the ones
  already poisoned.** Every install updated under v0.9.0–v0.9.2 carries a
  `kit.json` whose baseline is the *installed* file, so a customized hybrid still
  reads as "not modified by the user" and is still replaced — silently, with the
  update reporting `sdd:validate OK`.

  Measured on a second production repo before touching it: `update sdd` would
  have cut `context/constitution.md` from 265 to 220 lines and
  `context/context_prompt.md` from 251 to 227 — 69 lines of project context
  destroyed with no conflict, no `.new` and no warning.

  Hybrid files (`context/constitution.md`, `context/context_prompt.md`,
  `dual-harness/*`, `memory/lessons.md`, `pricing.json`) are now **never replaced
  silently**, regardless of what the baseline says. A hybrid that reaches the
  comparison already differs from the kit, so it is either the user's or
  partly theirs: it is preserved and the kit version lands as `*.new`. When it
  matches the kit there is nothing to do, so no spurious conflicts appear.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **`update sdd` destroyed, on the next run, the very files it had preserved.**
  `sdd/kit.json` was written by hashing the *installed* directory, so a file kept
  as a conflict — the user's `dual-harness/AGENTS.md`, their
  `context/constitution.md` — was recorded with its own local hash. The next
  update compared the file against that baseline, found them equal, concluded
  "not modified by the user" and replaced it with the kit's template. No
  conflict, no `.new`, no warning.

  Hit on a real repo doing two consecutive updates after a legacy install: a
  282-line project constitution came back as the empty kit template. The
  manifest now records what the **kit shipped** (`newManifest`), which is what
  the comparison always meant, so a preserved file keeps differing from its
  baseline and stays preserved.

  Anyone who ran two updates in a row since v0.6.1 should check
  `git diff` on `context/constitution.md`, `context/context_prompt.md` and
  `dual-harness/*` before updating again.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- The portability rule matched the project name as a bare substring, so a
  subproject whose name extends the repo's — `inv-trading-api` inside a project
  named `inv-trading` — was reported as a hardcoded leak. Real installs hit
  this on every context document that lists their own apps: 6 of 16 reported
  leaks in a production repo were the app name, not the project name. The check
  now requires a word boundary (`[A-Za-z0-9_-]` on neither side), so
  `shop-api` no longer trips a project called `shop` while a genuine
  `shop` reference still fails.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- `validate-sdd` skipped the telemetry warning for a completed cycle whose
  `metrics` is `null`: the check sat inside the `if (c.metrics)` guard, so the
  cycles with the least information were the ones that went unreported. Found
  against a production repo where the aggregated warning said 26 cycles when
  the real count was 28. The check now runs outside the guard — a cycle closed
  with `metrics: null` has no telemetry either, which is exactly what the
  warning is for. Still a warning, never an error.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed — telemetry was structurally optional, so Copilot (and every provider) silently skipped it

A real cycle closed on GitHub Copilot recorded no telemetry at all: `by_tier`
came back Claude-only. The report blamed Copilot, but the audit found the cause
was provider-independent — **no harness gives the reviewer a counter it can
read**. `/stats` (Gemini CLI) and the session usage report (Claude Code) are
client-side commands an agent cannot execute; Copilot and Antigravity expose no
counter at all. Combined with a protocol that said *"an honest approximation is
fine; an invented number is not — when in doubt, omit the field"*, the rational
move for every agent was to omit. Nothing enforced the opposite: the reviewer
**agent file** carried no telemetry step (only the skill did, marked
"best-effort"), `sdd-data-schemas` never documented the `usage` block, and
`validate-sdd` never checked it.

- **The escape hatch is gone.** "When in doubt, omit" is replaced everywhere by
  "when there is no counter, declare an estimate": dual-harness rule
  `sdd-model-budget.md`, `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md`, the reviewer skill,
  `sdd-hermes`, `review-cycle` and `hotfix-bypass-gate` prompts. Declaring
  provider/model is now non-negotiable — the model is always known.
- **New ⛔ TELEMETRÍA GATE** in `sdd-reviewer.agent.md` (closing step 11), with a
  per-harness source table and the estimation protocol. The reviewer agent had
  zero telemetry instructions before this release; so did both implementors,
  which now record per-task `usage`.
- **`approx` + `source` in all three `usage` blocks** (`cycle.json →
  metrics.usage` and each `by_tier` entry, per-task `usage`, per-fix `usage`).
  `source` is an enum: `session-report` · `stats-command` · `api-usage` ·
  `declared-estimate`. A cycle mixing a measured provider with an estimated one
  stays honest because `approx`/`source` also live per `by_tier` entry.
- **The viewer shows estimates instead of hiding them**: "Consumo por proveedor"
  gains an **Origen** column rendering `medido` / `estimado` /
  `parcialmente estimado` per provider (both languages).
- **`skipped` is a resolved task, not a pending one.** New optional
  `metrics.tasks_skipped`; a cycle closes when
  `tasks_completed + tasks_skipped == tasks_total`. The reviewer used to be told
  to mark *all* tasks `done`, which forced it to either lie or break the gate.
  Tasks/Planning views count skipped as resolved and surface the count.
- **`validate-sdd` warns, never fails**, on a completed cycle without
  `metrics.usage` or without `by_tier`, and on `skipped` tasks not reflected in
  `tasks_skipped`. Warnings are aggregated into one line so an existing repo does
  not get a wall of them.
- **`pricing.json` is merged, not replaced**: the viewer now layers a customized
  `pricing.json` over the kit defaults, so models added by later kit versions get
  priced instead of silently falling back to the assumed tier.
- **Antigravity records under `gemini/*`** (it runs Gemini models) — documented
  in the schemas, the rule and both languages of the kit docs, so its cost is not
  fragmented away from Gemini's.

### Backward compatibility

Every new field is **optional and additive**; nothing moved to `required` and no
existing check became stricter. Verified against a production install (21
`cycle.json`, 19 `tasks.json`, 62 fixes): all validate green against the new
schemas, and a simulated `update sdd` over that data produced **0 new errors and
1 aggregated warning**.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added — sdd-steward: the kit's concierge and single entry point

The kit had seven cycle agents and Hermes, but nobody owned operations on the
kit itself — "what's the SDD status?", "update the library", "kick off this
idea" landed on whatever generic agent was around, which had to rediscover the
kit every time.

- **New agent `sdd-steward`** (`sdd/agents/sdd-steward.agent.md`, `model:
  sonnet`) + skill (`sdd/skills/sdd-steward/SKILL.md`) + prompt
  (`/sdd-steward`, exposed automatically in all four harnesses: Claude Code
  slash command, Copilot prompt, Antigravity workflow, Gemini CLI TOML
  command — with no args it runs the status playbook).
- **Router, not a second orchestrator**: a hard routing table classifies any
  incoming request. The steward executes only operations with no other owner
  (harness/SDD status report, `update sdd` with its post-update checklist,
  cost/telemetry queries, harness health, methodology questions) and delegates
  the rest untouched — ideas to `sdd-hermes`, cycles/specs to
  `sdd-orchestrator`, urgent fixes to the FIX GATE. It never writes
  implementation code and never bypasses a gate.
- **Surgical reading map**: the skill encodes which registry answers which
  question (kit.json, global.json, specs index, fixes, lessons, catalog,
  pricing) so the steward "knows the whole kit" without ever loading it into
  context — economy tier by default per the ⚙️ rule.
- Kit counts: 8 agents, 19 skills, 6 prompts (catalog regenerated; docs and
  site updated in both languages).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added — Gemini/Antigravity as third harness provider, provider-aware costs, bilingual viewer

The harness was dual (Claude Code + GitHub Copilot) and its model/effort rule, cost
telemetry and viewer were Claude-only. This release makes Gemini (Antigravity IDE +
Gemini CLI) a first-class provider and generalizes the whole cost pipeline.

- **New harness surfaces** (created by `pnpm setup:agents`): root `GEMINI.md`
  (`sdd/dual-harness/GEMINI.md`, absorbed like AGENTS/CLAUDE on `configure sdd`);
  condensed always-on Antigravity rules in `.agents/rules/` (sources in
  `sdd/dual-harness/rules/`, each under the 12k-char cap); SDD skills exposed at
  `.agents/skills/` (shared SKILL.md standard: Antigravity + Gemini CLI); SDD prompts as
  Antigravity workflows in `.agent/workflows/` and as generated Gemini CLI TOML commands
  in `.gemini/commands/`; `.gemini/settings.json` merged so Gemini CLI also reads
  `AGENTS.md`. PowerShell mirror included; user files are never clobbered.
- **Per-provider model/effort rule**: the ⚙️ section of the three harness files now
  carries one canonical tier table (económico/estándar/alto/máximo) with Claude
  (`model`/`effort`), Gemini (model/`thinking_level`) and Copilot equivalences, plus
  per-provider enforcement — programmatic in Claude Code, `model:` frontmatter pinned in
  the 7 SDD agents for Copilot (Claude aliases; map once to your org's same-tier
  models), explicit dropdown-check-and-ask in Antigravity, per-session model + `/stats`
  in Gemini CLI.
- **Provider-namespaced cost telemetry**: `metrics.usage.by_tier`, `usage.model_tier`
  and `pricing.json` keys now take the `provider/model` form (`claude/opus`,
  `gemini/pro`, `copilot/gpt-5-mini`); bare legacy tiers remain valid and are read as
  `claude/*`. `pricing.json` ships per-provider rates (Gemini API tiers, Copilot
  usage-based token rates behind AI Credits).
- **Fixes join the cost registry**: optional `usage` (tokens, duration, model_tier) per
  fix in `sdd/fixes.json`, requested at fix close by the FIX GATE prompt and by the
  sdd-reviewer checklist.
- **Viewer**: bilingual ES/EN with a persisted language toggle (localStorage +
  `navigator.language` default; the docs tab follows the active language into
  `sdd/documentation/{es,en}/`); Costs view adds per-provider aggregation and a fixes
  cost table on top of the existing comparison.
- **sdd-hermes decoupled from concrete tiers**: phase budgets now use the abstract
  tiers and reference the canonical table; the loop-automation section covers all four
  harnesses (Claude Code, Copilot, Gemini CLI, Antigravity) and cycle close requires
  provider-namespaced telemetry.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed — skills are `SKILL.md` again, so Claude Code can actually find them

The kit shipped its 18 skills as lowercase `skill.md`. That satisfied the viewer, but broke
the one consumer that cannot be configured: Claude Code only discovers Agent Skills at
`.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, and on case-sensitive filesystems (Linux, cloud agents, WSL)
the lowercase file is simply not found — installed projects ended up with all skills
invisible to the agent.

- **All 18 kit skills renamed to `SKILL.md`** (uppercase — the Agent Skills standard), and
  every resolver aligned to the same case: `catalog.json` + `rebuild-catalog.mjs`,
  `catalog.schema.json` (`file` is now `const: "SKILL.md"`), the `sdd/docs` viewer, agents,
  prompts, context templates and both documentation editions.
- **`harness add skill` now writes `SKILL.md`** for user-created skills.
- **`harness update sdd` migrates existing installs**: unmodified lowercase `skill.md` files
  are removed as stale kit files and the uppercase editions take their place; `catalog.json`
  is regenerated. User-created skills are untouched (rename them to `SKILL.md` by hand so
  Claude Code picks them up too).
- The kit README's warning block taught the lowercase convention as a hard rule; it now
  explains the real constraint: git versions `SKILL.md` and every resolver must match that
  case — macOS hiding case mismatches is the trap, not the uppercase name.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-14

### Changed — the kit's documentation is now bilingual and lives in one place

The three methodology documents sat loose at the root of `sdd/` and existed only in Spanish —
and the site's English guide page was serving the Spanish text.

- **New layout**: `sdd/documentation/{es,en}/{INSTALL,HOW-TO-USE-SDD,README}.md`. The root
  `sdd/README.md` is now a short bilingual index pointing at both editions.
- **Full English editions** of the three documents (the English README summarizes the
  historical changelog with a pointer to the Spanish original, which remains the record).
- **The viewer's Help view** now offers the three documents — INSTALL first, since how to
  install and update the framework is the most important one — from the new paths.
- **The site's `guía sdd` page** follows the language switch (English pages get English
  manuals), adds the INSTALL tab, and drops the "manuals are Spanish-only" apology.
- `harness update sdd` migrates old installs cleanly: the root `HOW-TO-USE-SDD.md` and
  `INSTALL.md` are removed as stale kit files (if unmodified) and the new tree is added.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added — the loop activity feed, for real

The docs site demoed an "actividad del loop" feed that did not exist in the product. Now it
does: the `sdd:docs` viewer's cycle detail (Ciclos → open a cycle → **Actividad del ciclo**)
reconstructs the feed **exclusively from the registries** — nothing is invented, a line only
appears if its data exists:

- `sdd-orchestrator` opens the cycle (cycle.json).
- One line per design document present in `cycle.documents` (functional / planner / architect).
- One line per task from the cycle's `tasks.json`, with its status and — when the implementor
  recorded `usage` — its tokens and model tier (`352 k tokens (sonnet)`).
- `sdd-reviewer` closes it, with the `reviewer_report` verdict, on completed cycles.

The site demo now points at the real feature instead of floating free.

### Changed — the site's file trees now match the real output, file by file

The `sdd/` tree shown in "Los tres modos" omitted a third of what the CLI actually installs —
including `memory/` (the MEMORIA GATE base), `kit.json`, `pricing.json`, the six architecture
and index registries, and the three methodology documents. The three mode trees are now
complete and mirror the real examples repo directories (`flexi-market/`, `pulse-api/`,
`legacy-shop/`), each with a pointer to its example, in both languages.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed — `add app` now updates the root package.json like `init --config` does

An app added after the workspace existed was silently second-class: `harness add app` generated
the app and registered it in the SDD registries, but never touched the root `package.json`. The
app got none of the four nx convenience scripts, and — worse — none of its runtime dependencies:
`add app hono` produced an app that could not even start, because `hono` and
`@hono/node-server` were nowhere in the workspace. Found by diffing the two paths for the same
Spring Boot app in the examples repo.

Both paths now share one source (`generators/root-package.ts`) for what each app type
contributes to the root `package.json`:

- The four scripts (`<name>`, `build:<name>`, `test:<name>`, `lint:<name>`).
- The type's runtime and dev dependencies, **additive only** — a version already present is
  never overwritten.
- Adding a `react`/`nextjs` app to a workspace that was generated without the react family
  restores it, taking versions from the kit's own `sdd/templates/nx-workspace/package.json`.
- `springboot` and `python` contribute scripts only, as in `init` — they integrate via
  Maven/pyproject and ask nothing of the root `package.json`.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-08-13

### Added — the examples repo is now cited where users actually arrive

[e-burgos/sdd-harness-examples](https://github.com/e-burgos/sdd-harness-examples) (one real,
regenerated-from-npm example per mode) was only linked from the GitHub README and the docs
site — the surfaces where nobody lands first. Now it is referenced from:

- **This README** — the page npmjs.com shows.
- **The kit's `sdd/README.md`** — what the user reads inside their own generated repo.
- **The CLI itself** — every `harness init` path closes with a "See more examples" note.
- **The `sdd:docs` viewer** — an "Ejemplos completos" card in the Help view.

### Fixed

- **The docs site was horizontally clipped on phones.** The
  `npx @e-burgos/sdd-harness@latest update sdd` copy button cannot wrap, and as a grid item its
  automatic minimum size is the full one-line width of the command — so at 375–430px the layout
  viewport was forced to 461px and the whole page panned sideways, cutting content off at the
  left edge. `min-w-0` on the button and its grid column lets the existing `truncate` do its job.
- The npm README still advertised "16+ skills"; the kit ships 18.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-08-13

### Changed — the `sdd:docs` viewer uses the width it has

- **`--content-max` 1024px → 1360px.** The viewer is tables and cards, not prose: on a normal
  screen the content sat squeezed in the middle with dead margins on both sides. Long-form text
  is unaffected — markdown documents render inside a modal already capped at 896px.
- **Costs cards.** The saving cell packed the amount and the percentage into one string
  (`US$ 994,80 (99%)`), which wrapped onto two lines in a narrow card. The percentage is now its
  own badge under the value, the amount never wraps, and the KPI grid asks for 180px per card
  instead of 150px.
- **The bar chart label no longer truncates.** `eburgos-001-auth · cycle-01` did not fit the
  fixed 148px column; it is now `clamp(148px, 20%, 240px)`, so it grows on wide screens without
  squeezing the bar on narrow ones.

### Fixed

- **The two Costs tables were rendered without the `data-table` class**, so they got none of the
  table styling: no cell padding, no header treatment, columns running into each other.
- **The dashboard told a finished project that it had not started.** The "El ciclo SDD aún no ha
  iniciado" note keyed off `pending_modules` and `in_progress_modules` being empty, ignoring
  `completed_modules` — so a project with every module completed hit that branch and was told all
  its modules were `pending`.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-13

### Added — every prompt has a flag, so agents and CI can drive the whole CLI

An interactive prompt cannot be answered through stdin: @clack appends piped text to the
initial value and never submits, so any command missing a flag **hangs** rather than failing.
That made several commands unreachable for an AI agent or a CI job.

- **`configure sdd` is now scriptable**: `--name`, `--description` and `-y`. Installing SDD
  onto an existing repo was previously impossible without a TTY — it always asked for the
  project name and description with no way to skip.
- **`add spec`**: `--title` and `--app`, the two prompts that had no flag. `--app` is
  validated against `(apps|libs|tools)/<name>` before anything is written.
- **`add skill`**: `--description`.
- **`configure docker`**: `--services postgres,redis`. **`configure mcp`**: `--servers`.
  **`configure memory`**: `--providers`. All three take a comma-separated list validated
  against the catalog, and fail with the valid values instead of prompting.
- **`init --config` covers all seven app types**: `springboot` and `hono` were offered by the
  wizard and by `add app`, but the config schema stopped at `fastify`, so the path documented
  as "fully non-interactive init for AI agents and CI" could not generate the two
  blueprint-backed types. The JSON Schema export follows automatically — it derives from the
  same Zod schema.

### Fixed

- **`init` no longer dies when git has no identity.** It ends with `git init` + an initial
  commit; on a runner with no `user.email` that aborts with `fatal: empty ident name` and took
  the whole generation down with it, discarding a workspace that was already complete. The
  commit is now best-effort: it warns and leaves the workspace in place.
- **`harness add` announced a `libs` subcommand that does not exist** — libraries are declared
  in `libs[]` of `init --config`.
- **The CLI README documented skills as `SKILL.md`** in six places while the generator writes
  `skill.md`. On a case-sensitive checkout the uppercase name leaves the skill unreadable,
  which is the exact failure the lowercase rule exists to prevent.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-13

### Changed — English CLI output + bilingual docs site

- **CLI console output is now fully English.** The interactive wizard prompts were
  already English; the generator progress logs (`Creating directory structure...`,
  `Generating app: ...`, `Workspace "..." created successfully.`) and the
  `configure memory` notes/hints now match, so the CLI no longer mixes languages.
- **Bilingual documentation site (ES/EN).** sdd.estebanburgos.com.ar now ships a
  language switch in the header (persisted in `localStorage`, defaulting to the
  browser language). All sections, the live-costs demo, the sdd:docs viewer page and
  the guide page chrome are fully translated; the kit manuals themselves remain in
  Spanish (the kit's working language) with an explanatory note in English mode.
  The hero terminal animation now replays the **real** `harness init` wizard
  end-to-end (prompts, generator steps, `sdd:validate`, git init).

### Changed — selective viewer reactivity + end-to-end documentation

- **Selective live sync in the SDD viewer.** `/sdd/docs/__state` now reports a sha1
  fingerprint **per registry area** (`global`, `specs`, `tasks`, `fixes`, `context`,
  `memory`, `arch`, `pricing`, `catalog`, …) alongside the global one. Each viewer
  view declares its area dependencies; a change only re-renders the active view when
  it touches an area the view depends on (closing a cycle refreshes Costos/Ciclos
  without touching Agentes), while the data cache is always invalidated so navigation
  stays fresh. Re-renders now **preserve UI state**: expanded sections and tabs are
  restored by replaying their real toggles, and search inputs and scroll position are
  restored in place. Backwards compatible with an older `serve.mjs` (single
  fingerprint → treated as "everything changed").
- **Documentation overhaul.** Kit docs gained the hermes-era chapters: HOW-TO section
  10 (idea → producto, memoria, telemetría y Costos con ejemplos concretos), kit
  README MEMORIA GATE section + `memory/`/`pricing.json` in the structure tree.
  The full Spanish guide (`docs/README.md`) documents `harness idea`,
  `config schema`, `configure memory` and `update sdd` with examples. The published
  docs site gained two sections: **Idea → producto** (interactive 5-phase hermes
  walkthrough with real commands) and **Costos en vivo** (an animated simulation of
  the live dashboard closing a cycle), per-mode working-session examples in the
  three-modes section, and the real Costos screenshot as the featured sdd:docs shot.

### Added — Hermes phases 3–5: usage telemetry, loop automation, opt-in memory, Costs dashboard

- **Usage telemetry (F3).** Optional, strictly-typed `usage` fields in the kit schemas:
  per-task (`cycle-tasks.schema.json` → `tokens_in`/`tokens_out`/`duration_minutes`/
  `model_tier`) and per-cycle aggregate (`cycle.schema.json` → `metrics.usage` with
  `by_tier`). Backwards compatible — existing registries validate unchanged. The
  sdd-reviewer records it at cycle close (new checklist item); the dual-harness ⚙️
  section documents the rule. New `sdd/pricing.json` (hybrid — local edits win on
  update) with editable traditional hourly rate and $/MTok per model tier, validated
  by the new `pricing.schema.json`.
- **Loop automation (F3).** New `sdd/prompts/hermes-resume.prompt.md`: standalone
  resume prompt that re-enters the hermes loop from the registries alone (position
  diagnosis, cut conditions, budget-first). The sdd-hermes skill documents optional
  Claude Code automation: `/loop`, Routines, and a `SessionStart` hook snippet that
  injects `memory/lessons.md`.
- **`harness configure memory` (F4).** Opt-in MCP memory providers on top of the
  portable `sdd/memory/` base: `basic-memory` (local-first Markdown) and the official
  `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` knowledge graph persisted inside the repo at
  `sdd/memory/knowledge-graph.json`. Non-destructive `.mcp.json` merge; no API keys.
- **Costs dashboard in the SDD viewer (F5).** New `Costos` view: KPI tiles (estimated
  hours, traditional cost, tokens, approximate agentic cost, projected savings),
  per-spec traditional-vs-agentic comparison bars, stacked in/out tokens per cycle,
  a precise per-cycle table, and a methodology card with the editable rates. Computed
  live from the registries (no generated intermediate) with a CVD-validated palette,
  hover tooltips and direct labels. Untier-ed tokens are priced at the `sonnet` rate
  and flagged.
- **Live auto-refresh (F5).** `serve.mjs` gains a `/sdd/docs/__state` endpoint (sha1
  fingerprint over registry mtimes, `docs/`/`templates/` excluded); the viewer polls
  it every 4s on localhost and re-renders the active view when the SDD state changes —
  task done, cycle closed or spec completed shows up without reloading. Static/prod
  hosting keeps the previous manual-refresh behavior; polling pauses while a modal is
  open or the tab is hidden, and stops after repeated failures.

### Added — Hermes phase 2: single idea entry point + inspectable config contract

- **`harness idea "<text>"`** — the deterministic entry point of the hermes end-to-end
  flow. Persists `harness.idea.md` (idea verbatim + the protocol with human checkpoints)
  and, on an empty repo, scaffolds `harness.config.json` + `harness.config.schema.json`
  ready for `init --config`. Inside an existing SDD workspace it switches to the
  gap-analysis protocol (`harness add app|service|spec`). Never overwrites without
  `--force`.
- **`harness config schema [--out <file>]`** — prints (or writes) the JSON Schema of the
  `init --config` contract, derived from the same zod schema the CLI validates with
  (via `zod-to-json-schema`), so agents and editors validate configs without running
  the CLI.
- `project.packageScope` validation is now a clean regex (`@scope`) instead of zod's
  `.startsWith()`, whose generated JSON-Schema pattern (`^\@`) was rejected by ajv.

### Added — Hermes phase 1: portable memory, non-interactive init, end-to-end loop skill

- **Portable memory system (`sdd/memory/` — MEMORIA GATE 🧠).** The kit now ships a
  versioned, agent-agnostic self-learning layer: `memory/lessons.md` (distilled lessons,
  hard 120-line cap, read whole at every session start) + `memory/journal/` (append-only
  episodic entries written at cycle/fix close, never bulk-read — grep on demand). Same
  unique-by-construction naming and single-actor merge pattern as the additive context
  fragments: the orchestrator distills the journal into `lessons.md` at ≥5 entries.
  Enforced across the kit: new 🧠 section in `dual-harness/AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`,
  reviewer checklist item + close step, orchestrator distillation step, and
  `validate-sdd.mjs` checks (journal entry naming, distillation threshold warning,
  lessons line-cap warning — all tolerant of pre-memory installs). Update boundary:
  `memory/lessons.md` is hybrid (local edits win by hash), `memory/journal/` is user
  data (`harness update sdd` never touches it); existing installs receive `memory/`
  automatically on update.
- **`harness init --config <file>` actually works now** — the flag existed but was never
  consumed. Fully non-interactive, agent/CI-friendly init: JSON (or `.mjs`/`.js` with
  `defineConfig`) validated with zod — clear per-path errors — and mapped straight to the
  generators. Schema gains `mode: "nx" | "standalone"` and `libs`; `nx` block and service
  `port` are now optional (generator defaults apply). New `HarnessConfigInput`/`LibConfig`
  exports in the programmatic API.
- **New kit skill `sdd-hermes`** — the end-to-end conductor: natural-language idea →
  discovery (max one round of questions) → stack decision matrix + human checkpoint →
  workspace configuration via `init --config` / `harness add` → one spec per module +
  human checkpoint → chained SDD cycles until the backlog is done. Declares a
  model/effort budget per phase and mandatory stop conditions (repeated red validation,
  out-of-spec product decisions, exhausted usage budget) — all state lives in the SDD
  registries so any future session can resume the loop. Never bypasses SPEC/CONTEXTO/
  MEMORIA gates.
- Architecture & roadmap document for the initiative: `docs/hermes.md` (root repo docs).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **`monorepo.libs` ahora es un mapa `nombre -> descripción`, igual que `monorepo.apps`.** Antes era
  un string fijo (`"libs/ — Shared libraries"`), así que el visor de `pnpm sdd:docs` no tenía de
  dónde sacar las libs: las únicas que listaba venían de un array `contextSeeds` hardcodeado con
  nombres del repo del que se extrajo el kit (`api-client`, `config`, `sdd-docs`). En un workspace
  real eso significaba libs ausentes del dashboard y cuatro 404 por carga de página.
  - `schemas/global.schema.json`: `libs` acepta el mapa. El string sigue siendo válido para que los
    kits instalados antes de este cambio no fallen la validación (en esa forma las libs no se
    listan en `sdd:docs`).
  - `docs/app.js`: `collectContextCandidates()` lee `monorepo.libs` y `contextSeeds` queda vacío —
    los subproyectos salen de los datos, no de nombres horneados en el visor.
  - `sdd.generator.ts`: `registerSubprojectInSDD()` registraba solo apps; ahora registra ambas
    categorías, y el `global.json` inicial se siembra con las libs elegidas por el usuario.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added — the three product modes

- **Standalone mode** (`harness init --standalone` or the new mode selector in `init`): generates ONE
  app with its code at the repo root — no Nx, no `apps/` — plus the full SDD system. All 7 app types
  supported: `react` and `springboot` from the kit blueprints root-ified (Nx-only artifacts stripped,
  self-contained configs), `nestjs` via `@nestjs/cli`, plain `nextjs`, `fastify`/`hono` with
  `tsx` + `tsc` + vitest, `python` with `pyproject.toml`. The repo registers itself in the SDD
  registries as a single logical app `apps/<name>` — the strict schemas stay untouched, every gate
  works unchanged, and the convention is documented in the generated subproject context.
- **SDD-harness mode** (`harness configure sdd`, hardened): installs the SDD system on an existing
  project without touching its code. Detects the repo shape (Nx monorepo vs standalone), infers app
  types from stack markers, auto-merges the `sdd:*` + `setup:agents` scripts and `ajv`/`ajv-formats`
  into the existing `package.json` (or creates a minimal one for pure Java/Python repos), and
  **absorbs pre-existing `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`** into `sdd/dual-harness/` under an
  "Instrucciones previas del proyecto" section before replacing them with symlinks.
- **`harness update sdd`** — updates the installed kit to the CLI's bundled version preserving all
  project data. Hash baseline in `sdd/kit.json` (written on every install) distinguishes
  user-modified kit files from kit-changed ones: untouched → replaced, customized → kept (with the
  new version as `<file>.new` + conflict report), user-added → never touched, data
  (`global.json`, `specs/`, `fixes/`, `context/**`, registries) → never touched. Finishes with
  script re-merge, `setup:agents`, catalog rebuild and `sdd:validate`. Legacy installs (no
  manifest) get a one-time conservative mode that never overwrites hybrids.
- `examples/` folder with the three modes generated for real: `test-sdd-nx-workspace`,
  `test-sdd-standalone`, `test-sdd-harness`.
- Integration tests for both new modes (real `setup-agents.sh` + `validate-sdd.mjs` + absorption).
- **Documentation site** (`apps/documentation`, deployed at https://sdd.estebanburgos.com.ar):
  interactive docs for the CLI — live terminal demo, the three modes with generated file trees,
  command reference, SDD methodology, `sdd:docs` viewer showcase with real screenshots, and the
  full kit manual (README + HOW-TO) rendered in-site.

### Changed

- **Repo reorganized as a pnpm workspace** — the publishable package moved from the repo root to
  `apps/cli/` (source, blueprints, portable kit, build config). Root keeps a private workspace
  `package.json` whose `build`/`test`/`typecheck` scripts proxy via `pnpm --filter`, plus the
  repo-level dual harness (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`) and `examples/`. The release workflow now
  publishes with `pnpm --filter @e-burgos/sdd-harness publish` (pnpm 10).
- **Portable SDD kit as single source of truth** — `templates/sdd/` is now a verbatim copy of the
  portable SDD system (7 agents, 16+ skills, gate prompts, strict JSON Schemas, validator scripts,
  zero-dependency docs viewer, dual-harness and scaffolding blueprints). The generator copies it
  as-is and only writes `sdd/global.json`, which is the **single source of truth** for project
  name/description (`pnpm sdd:validate` fails if they leak into any kit file). All `sdd/*.ejs`
  templates were removed and the `ejs` dependency dropped.
- **Root workspace config from the kit** — `package.json`, `nx.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`,
  `tsconfig.base.json`, `.gitignore` and `.npmrc` now derive from `templates/sdd/templates/nx-workspace/`
  (Nx 23.1.1 + pnpm 10, globs `apps/* libs/* tools/*`, `onlyBuiltDependencies`), adjusted
  programmatically per selected stack. Ships the `sdd:*` scripts + `setup:agents` and
  `ajv`/`ajv-formats` for the validator.
- **`springboot` apps migrated from Gradle to Maven** — generated from the `sdd/templates/apps/java-api`
  blueprint (hexagonal architecture) integrated with Nx via `nx:run-commands` → `mvn`. Removed
  `settings.gradle`, `gradle.properties`, `@nx/gradle` and the Gradle wrapper bootstrap.
- **`react` apps and TS libs from blueprints** — `sdd/templates/apps/react-app` (Vite + react-router +
  Docker/nginx) and `sdd/templates/libs/ts-lib`, with token renaming per the `scaffold-nx` skill.
- **`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` are now symlinks** to `sdd/dual-harness/`, created by `setup-agents`
  (also links `.claude/` and `.github/` agents, skills and prompts).
- **`harness add spec` rewritten for the v2.0 convention** — `spec-[author]-[NNN]-[slug]/` folders,
  per-author counters and registration in `sdd/specs/index.json`.
- **`harness add app` registers the app in SDD** — updates `sdd/global.json` (`monorepo.apps`) and
  creates `sdd/context/apps/[name]/` with its additive `updates/` directory.
- **`harness add skill` writes `skill.md`** (lowercase, with frontmatter) — Linux checkouts are
  case-sensitive and the kit resolves the lowercase name.

### Added

- `.nxignore` with `sdd/templates` so blueprint `project.json` files stay out of the Nx project graph.
- Final `sdd:validate` run after workspace generation.
- Integration test that runs the real `setup-agents.sh` and `validate-sdd.mjs` against a generated workspace.

### Fixed (found in the end-to-end trial)

- Generated root `package.json` now includes `@nx/eslint-plugin` + `typescript-eslint` — the CLI ships
  its own `eslint.config.mjs` (the kit assumes `create-nx-workspace` generates both), so `nx lint`
  failed with `Cannot find package '@nx/eslint-plugin'`.
- **Kit blueprint `react-app`**: `project.json` `test` target used `@nx/vite:test`,
  an executor that no longer exists in Nx 23 (`@nx/vite` only ships `build`/`dev-server`/`preview-server`).
  Replaced with `nx:run-commands` → `vitest run --passWithNoTests`, same pattern `java-api` uses for Maven.
- **Kit blueprint `java-api`**: `src/test/resources/application.yml` shadows the main
  one on the test classpath and defined `TOKEN_SIGNER_KEY` as a flat YAML key, which `@Value("${token.signer.key}")`
  cannot resolve (relaxed binding only applies to real environment variables) — `mvn test` failed to start
  the Spring context. It now defines `token.signer.key` directly.
- `harness info` no longer reports the removed `current_cycle` field (cycles are per-spec in v2.0);
  it now shows module lists and registered apps from `global.json`.
- `hono` apps (Nx mode) had the same dead `@nx/vite:test` executor in their `test` target —
  replaced with `nx:run-commands` → `vitest run --passWithNoTests`.
- **Kit blueprint `java-api`**: `nx lint` (`mvn checkstyle:check`) reported 422
  violations because the plugin ran with the default `sun_checks.xml` — a ruleset that demands Javadoc
  everywhere (incompatible with the kit's "no code comments" rule) and enforces brace/80-column style
  the blueprint never used. The blueprint now ships its own `checkstyle.xml` (real-defect checks:
  unused imports, `equals` without `hashCode`, string `==`, missing braces, line length 140, naming),
  wired via `configLocation` in `pom.xml` with `includeTestSourceDirectory`. The genuine findings it
  surfaced were fixed in the sources: 3 braceless `if` statements and 200+-char Swagger annotation
  lines. `nx lint orders-api` → 0 violations.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- **`springboot` app type** — Spring Boot 3.5 + Java 21 scaffold using **Gradle** and `@nx/gradle`
  - `build.gradle` con Groovy DSL, Spring Boot 3.5, Java 21 toolchain
  - `project.json` mínimo (targets inferidos por `@nx/gradle` automáticamente)
  - `Application.java`, `HealthController.java`, `application.properties`, `ApplicationTests.java`
  - `Dockerfile` multi-stage con `eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine`
  - `settings.gradle` raíz con plugin `dev.nx.gradle.project-graph v1.4.0`
  - `gradle.properties` con configuración de daemon y caché paralela
  - Gradle wrapper generado automáticamente (`gradle wrapper 8.14`)
  - `@nx/gradle` añadido a `devDependencies` del workspace
- **`hono` app type** — API ultra-rápida con [Hono](https://hono.dev) sobre Node.js usando `@nx/node + vite`
  - `main.ts` con `Hono` + `@hono/node-server`, endpoint `/api/v1/health`
  - `project.json` con targets `build` (`@nx/vite`), `serve` (`@nx/js:node`), `lint`, `test`
  - `vite.config.ts` en modo lib, target `node18`, externals `hono` y `@hono/node-server`
  - `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`, `tsconfig.spec.json`
  - `hono ^4.7.0` y `@hono/node-server ^1.14.0` añadidos a `dependencies` del workspace
- **Nx workspace bootstrap en 3 fases** — garantiza que NX esté completamente inicializado antes de generar apps y libs
  - **Fase 1**: creación de directorios + config files + `pnpm install` + `nx reset`
  - **Fase 2**: `process.chdir(root)` + generación selectiva (Docker, SDD, apps, libs, Gradle setup)
  - **Fase 3**: `git init` + commit inicial
- **`pnpm-workspace.yaml`** corregido — YAML con formato correcto (lista indentada)
- **`@nx/gradle`** en `nx.json` con `include: ["apps/**/*"]` y opciones `testTargetName` / `ciTestTargetName`
- **Plugins NX condicionales** en `package.json` del workspace generado — solo se incluyen los plugins necesarios según las apps seleccionadas

### Fixed

- **YAML malformado** en `pnpm-workspace.yaml.ejs` — `packages` estaba en una sola línea, causaba error `bad indentation of a mapping entry` al ejecutar `pnpm install`
- **Orden de inicialización** — las dependencias de NX se instalan antes de generar apps/libs, evitando referencias a `node_modules/nx/schemas/project-schema.json` inexistentes
- **CWD incorrecto** en generadores de apps/libs — `process.chdir(root)` asegura que los comandos NX y las rutas relativas operen desde dentro del proyecto generado

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **GitHub Actions Workflow** for automated NPM publishing using Trusted Publishing (OIDC).

### Fixed

- **Module Resolution**: Switched compiled JS files extension to `.js` under ESM configuration and updated entrypoints in `package.json`.
- **CLI Import Path**: Updated binary launcher `bin/harness.mjs` to target the correct built path at `dist/cli.js`.
- **Clean Distribution**: Removed duplicate `bin/` and `templates/` folders from the compiled output `dist/`.

  - SDD methodology toggle
  - Configuration summary with confirmation
- **`harness add app`** — add a new app to an existing workspace
- **`harness add skill`** — add SDD agent skills
- **`harness add service`** — add infrastructure services
- **`harness configure sdd`** — configure SDD methodology
